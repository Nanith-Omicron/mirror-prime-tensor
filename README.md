# Mirror Prime Tensor Walk via XOR Delta Fields

### Abstract
We introduce the Mirror Prime Tensor (MPT), a novel discrete tensor system based on
reversible recursion through prime-indexed XOR deltas. MPT is a deterministic, mirrorsymmetric structure with applications in cryptography, discrete optimization, and multidimensional coordinate encoding. It combines bitwise calculus with energetic modulation,
enabling the construction of cryptographic primitives, encryption protocols, and physical
analogs in XOR space. This paper presents the core definitions, calculus framework, cryptographic modeling, and early physical analogues of the MPT system.
